Imperative
	code focuses on creating statements that change program states by creating algorithms that tell the computer how to do things.
	Typically your code will make use of conditinal statements, loops and class inheritence.
	Essentially in imperative code you define what you want to happen, step by step
	Example: C, Java

Declarative
	focuses on building logic of software without actually describing its flow.
	You are saying what without adding how.
	Functional programming based on lambda calculus is Turing complete, avoids states, side effects and mutation of data. 
	You create expressions instead of statements and evaluate functions. You don’t have any use for loops and for the same argument your function will always return the same value.
	With declarative programming, on the other hand, you write code that describes what you want, but not necessarily how to get it (declare your desired results, but not the step-by-step)
	Example: JavaScript
