Entities in a programming language (variables, constants, functions) that can be used same as others like passing a variable & passing a function is same. These kind of objects are first class objects.

Example:
Java methods do not accepts methods as parameters hence methods are second class objects.
JavaScript however can accept functions as parameters hence these are first class objects.
